        <h1><bold>Three Websites Ranked!</bold></h1>
        
        <h2>1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target=_blank >youtube</a> </h2>

        <p>     In my opinion, the magnitud of this website's services are inimaginable. First the way they show you new videos everytime you hit the refresh button, but after inspecting the coding, I found out the script is the same throughout the coding. While looking at the coding, I realized the scripts are the orders the computer is given but gives you different results according to your algorithm. </p>
        
        <h2>2. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target=_blank>Netflix</a> </h2>

        <p>     In my opinion, Netflix has a better home page compared to youtube. While inspecting netflix website's coding, I found that Netflix stack their sections on top of each other which makes it a lot easier to track and keep up with. When hovering through the box of code, the part in the website would highlight; as a result, it was cool to see the code and the code in action on the website. </p>
        
        <h2>3. <a href="https://www.soloboxeo.com/foro/viewtopic.php?t=3743" target=_blank>Solo Boxeo</a> </h2>

        <p>     In my opinion, this is one of the worst websites I could find. I realized a mexican boxing store would be the one store to have a really website to check out. Results show that I was right, and I inspected their coding just to find out that coding takes time wheter the website is good or the website is bad.  </p>
